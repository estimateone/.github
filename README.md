This repository contains default files for EstimateOne repositories. Default files are not included in clones, packages, or downloads of individual repositories because they are stored only in the `.github` repository.

If you override a single issue template, you will not inherit any other issue templates. There is no “merging” of issue templates. You are able to override issue templates, and still inherit pull request templates.
